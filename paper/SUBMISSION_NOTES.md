# Preprint submission notes

## Target venues (recommended order)
- arXiv (immediate)
- NeurIPS/ICLR workshops (Systems/Efficient Foundation Models)
- MLSys (best fit if evaluation is expanded across devices/backends)

## What NOT to claim in public (until evidence artifacts exist)
- L16/L32/L64 performance wins
- "lossless" quality statements
- forward-looking roadmap promises

## Minimal upgrades to strengthen the paper
- Add 2–3 hardware tiers (desktop CPU, laptop, edge box)
- Add at least one additional backend configuration
- Add one real-world scenario beyond microbench (e.g., TTFT, sustained throughput)
- Provide an artifact diff/rollback demonstration
